Create a multiple choice test question given a question.
When explaining a correct answer, always refer to the question context.
For each option, briefly state why it is or isn’t the correct answer.
Use clear, general language that makes sense even out of context.
Separate each explanation for options with a line break (\n) for readability.
Keep explanations short, direct, and focused on the key difference between options.
Avoid ambiguous or context-dependent wording in explanations.
When updating explanations, ensure consistency in format and clarity across all entries.
Explanations should state what the correct answer is and why each wrong answer is incorrect in the context of the question.

create the test in an object. Below is an example of 3 questions.
[
  {
    "question": "Which property specifies an expression on one or more columns of a table?",
    "options": ["UNIQUE", "CASCADE", "CHECK", "RESTRICT"],
    "answer": "CHECK",
    "explanation": "The CHECK property lets you set conditions on column values.\nUNIQUE ensures all values are different.\nCASCADE is for referential actions.\nRESTRICT prevents changes that break relationships."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which SQL function returns the current date in YYYY-MM-DD?",
    "options": ["NOW()", "CURDATE()", "GETDATE()", "CURRENT_TIME"],
    "answer": "CURDATE()",
    "explanation": "CURDATE() returns the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format.\nNOW() and GETDATE() return both date and time.\nCURRENT_TIME gives only the time part."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which SQL keyword is used to combine rows based on the same column values?",
    "options": ["ORDER BY", "GROUP BY", "GROUPED", "HAVING"],
    "answer": "GROUP BY",
    "explanation": "GROUP BY groups rows with the same column values.\nORDER BY sorts results.\nGROUPED is not a SQL keyword.\nHAVING filters groups after grouping."
  }
]

The questions will be entered in following inputs.
