When explaining a correct answer, always refer to the question context.
For each option, briefly state why it is or isn’t the correct answer.
Use clear, general language that makes sense even out of context.
Separate each explanation for options with a line break (\n) for readability.
Keep explanations short, direct, and focused on the key difference between options.
Avoid ambiguous or context-dependent wording in explanations.
When updating explanations, ensure consistency in format and clarity across all entries.
Explanations should state what the correct answer is and why each wrong answer is incorrect in the context of the question.
